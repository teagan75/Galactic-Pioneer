# Teagan's Guide to the Galaxy
Space Exploration and Travel

This mod pack is designed for players who love to explore space yet have more control over it. This pack is designed around the Warp Drive mod by LemADEC. This mod gives players the ability to design and craft their own spaceship and "fly" it in space and to other planets via Warp technology.  This mod also brings other SciFi technologies to the player that includes: lasers for combat and mining asteroids for resources, player transporter, cloaking and shield devices, and much more. 
 
The other mods included in the pack are mainly technological and everything you could possible want on your mobile base. This pack is not designed for balance, although I hope the mods compliment themselves well enough. It was made for players to have fun.
 
This pack is in its early stages of testing, so there may be mod conflicts and/or broken items. Currently, it is only possible to reach the moon via the space dimension. More to come in the future. Please report any issues you find or suggestions here.

Known issues: 
- Galacticraft blocks/machines do not rotate properly with the ship.
- Warp drive air generator does not work in Galacticraft moon dim, so you will need GC's air system on your ship.
- Warp drive helmet does not work in GC's moon dim, so you will need GC's spacesuit and helmet plus air tank there.
